Now let's start our main project app for this course:

Navigate out of todoapp and into rails_projects directory

From there (rails_projects directory), type in:
rails new myrecipes

This will build the new app

Test it out by typing in:
cd myrecipes

Then run the rails server:
rails s -b $IP -p $PORT

Test out that you get the rails main welcome page from the browser, then shut down the server

Initiate a git repo:
git init

Then make a commit:
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Create a new repository in your github account, then follow the steps (two lines) to move existing app to your github repo

Then test it out and ensure your app is pointing to the right repo by typing in:
git remote -v

Reload the github page and ensure your latest commit/project is showing up

Congratulations!
