Skip adding ActiveStorage on new builds https://mikerogers.io/2018/04/13/remove-activestorage-from-rails-5-2.html
Create new myrecipes app
$ rails new myrecipes --skip-active-storage

## change below for heroku
- replace `sqlite3` to `pg` in Gemfile
- update `adapter:` and `database:` in config/database.yml to
`adapter: postgresql`
- change the database: to a custom name
`database: my_database_development`
`database: my_database_test`
`database: my_database_production`

## for guard and LiveReload on webpage
- add `'guard' 'guard-rspec' 'guard-livereload' 'rb-readline' 'pry-coolline'` into Gemfile `group :development, :test ` to run guard LiveReload
- add `guardfile` to app directory

## deploy on heroku

## Minitest
Layout of the application

## integration testing
## Model Tests - unit testing
$ rails g integration_test pages
$ rails test
TDD - design the app functionality based on a test first approach
Write the test for the functionality
Build minimum code necessary to make each test pass

Re-factor the code - *code doesn't smell* - clean code, confidence
Look at some sample layouts for homepage, and come up with a homepage design

1. Create a mockup! Or use Bootstrap
Bootstrap
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/
Using this template
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/jumbotron/

# 46 notes ===========================
learn to code html & css

# 48 notes ===========================
copy navigation bar from website
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar

for css color
google `htom color picker` use #073815 for green

- use bootstrap `jumbotron` example as body style in 
home.html.erb
<div class = "jumbotron"></div>

- add `yield` field into `container`
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
    <div class = "container">
      <%= yield %>
    </div>
- change text align to center
home.html.erb
    <div class = "jumbotron center"> </div>
custom.css.scss add
    .center {
        text-align: center;
    }

# 50 notes ===========================
- change background
https://unsplash.com/

- add three column on home page
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/justified-nav/
choose example, right click -> view page source
<!-- Example row of columns -->
copy below <div></div>
<!-- Site footer -->

- homework
Assignment: Create the footer, add styling and then paste an image of it to the Q & A!

Recipes
ID, name, descrtiption, chef_id

Chefs
ID, name, email

# 56 notes ===========================
Recipe 
- recipe should be valid
- name should be present
- description should be present 
- chef_id should be present -- later **
- maximum length for name and description, maybe a minimum for description

Chef
- chefname should be present
- email should be present
- size restrictions on email and chefname
- email address should be valid format
- email should be unique, case insensitive

$ rails test <!-- run test -->
    #validates :name, presence: true <!-- comment this in recipe.rb -->

Build new recipe page
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms
you can use form from above page, but don't use <form></form>tag, you can copy and paste code between <form></form> tag, but don't cope this tag, it will get you the trouble when you use this in ruby

# 129 notes ===========================
Admin user functionality
- Permission system virtual necessity in every web based/software app
- Can be very complex, in CRM or Project Management app's they're one of the primary features
- There can be separate tables with permissions for different user levels
    *This means multiple actions on each and every page will need to hit the database for cheks - compromising performance
- Simpler permission based system - You can have a role attribute added to users
    *Roles can be admin, supervisor, moderator etc with different access levels
- For our app we'll add an admin attribute if true then the user is an admin. The default will be false
- We' ll update our views and controllers based on this
- Admins will have full access - editing other chefs's recipes, updating chef info, deleting other chefs


## in db change chef to admin true

## read many-to-many association

# Section06_133 notes ===========================
Ingredients
- many-to-many association
- skip buiding test-suite
- building faster
- still no generators unless necessory!
- has_many :through
- will be present in all recipes
- each recipe may have more than 1 ingredient - many ingredients
- same ingredient can be used by many recipes
![Many to Many association](Udemy_video/Sec06_Many2ManyAssoc/#133_M2MAssoc.png)
![Comments](Udemy_video/Sec06_Many2ManyAssoc/#133_comments.png)
- We will start building the back-end of this

Comments and Ingredients!


# 134 notes ===========================
Ingredients
- will have many attribute
- will have many-to-many association with recipes

later on -
- Only admin users will be able to add ingredients

# Section 7 151 notes ===========================
read WebSocket https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket
read xhr https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest

WebSocket is computer commuications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a signle TCP connection

- The WebSocket protocol makes more interaction between a browser and a seb server possible, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.
-This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the brower without being solicited by the client, and allowing for messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open.
- In this way, a two-way (bi-directional) ongoing conversation can take place between a browser and the server.

What you need to remember:
- The realtime socket connectin between the client (browser) and server (Your web server/app) is handled by the rails ActionCable.
- THis commnunication is handled by Javascript wrappers for websockets on both end.
![]{Udemy_video/Sec07_RealtimeRails/#151-1.png}
![]{Udemy_video/Sec07_RealtimeRails/#151-2.png}

You have to specify two things:
1) In config/application.rb -> You have show the path in which the cable items will be exposed.
 It's the route which the client (browser) will call in order to make the websocket connection with the server (which is where the actioncable server will be mounted)
2) In your config/routes.rb file -> You have to expose the actual path
so in 1) You're saying where the path will be, and 2) You're giving the path

The third part of this is the channel ->
1) Here you'll mention where to stream from, you can have multiple websocket connections between browser and server, you have to name your stream something, for example, for our comments feature wi'll name it comments
2) Once the stream is established, from the server it's sending a stream, the client is now subscribed to new items that com in, so the server sends a message and client receives it.

## start to work
- generate `app/channels/comments_channel.rb`
$ rails g channel comments
